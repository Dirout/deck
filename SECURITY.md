# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not publicly disclose a vulnerability for at least 30 days.

To report a vulnerability, email [em@emsa.cf](mailto:em@emsa.cf), and expect a response within 30 days.
If the matter cannot be privately resolved, make a pull request to put the platform into maintenance mode, and then [make a GitHub issue](https://github.com/MadeByEmil/deck/issues/new/choose) to resolve it with others.
