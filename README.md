The experimental live video platform.

P2P, serverless video streaming. As indie as you can make it.

# Currently being rewritten from scratch, lots of development taking place on [deck-stream](https://github.com/MadeByEmil/deck-stream), web interface will collect `deck-stream` streams, abandoning HLS + GitHub Pages model. Transitioning to hyper:// protocol instead.
